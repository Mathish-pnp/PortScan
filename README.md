# Task: Local Network Port Scan (Parrot OS)

## Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Wireshark

## Nmap:

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source tool used for:

  -  Network discovery

  -  Port scanning

  -  Security auditing

## Ports:

A port is a virtual gate on a device where network connections start and end.

Ports range from 0 to 65535.

Each port is associated with a specific service (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).

| Port | Service        | Protocol |
| ---- | -------------- | -------- |
| 22   | SSH            | TCP      |
| 80   | HTTP           | TCP      |
| 443  | HTTPS          | TCP      |
| 3389 | Remote Desktop | TCP      |


## OpenPort:

Open ports are actively listening for connections.

They are potential entry points for attackers.

Every open port = a running service = a possible vulnerability

## Types of Port States in Nmap:

open	      :Port is accepting connections
closed	    :Port is accessible but no service is listening
filtered	  :Port is blocked by a firewall or router
unfiltered	:Nmap canâ€™t determine the state

## Commonly Exploited Open Ports:

| Port    | Service | Risk Example                              |
| ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 21      | FTP     | Plaintext login, anonymous access         |
| 22      | SSH     | Brute-force attacks, weak passwords       |
| 23      | Telnet  | Unencrypted, outdated                     |
| 80      | HTTP    | Web exploits, outdated CMSs               |
| 139/445 | SMB     | EternalBlue, ransomware spread (WannaCry) |
| 3306    | MySQL   | Database leakage                          |
| 3389    | RDP     | Remote desktop hijacking                  |

## Security Implications:

  - Properly configured

  -  Updated

  - Access-restricted (firewalled or internal-only)

You should close unused ports or filter them with iptables or ufw.
